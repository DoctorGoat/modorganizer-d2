A modder for Final Fantasy 14 wouldn't be anywhere without Nasir Gebelli doing Final Fantasy 1-3. 

I wouldn't be anywhere in Diablo without the Eastern Sun Eclipse crew, which wouldn't be anywhere without Tsuru, Perfect Cell, and others. They wouldn't be anywhere without other modding tools from Phrozen Keep and long defunct sites. I don't think anyone would be far in Diablo 2 modding without the work of Ysolde, and so on.
